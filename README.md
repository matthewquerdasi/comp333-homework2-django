## How to query the database

To add a user go to the Users model database go to /musicdb/register and enter a username and password.

### Retrieve ratings by username 
To retrieve ratings by a user go to /musicdb/retrieve and enter a username. We input some test entries under the username 'test', so you can use that to check.
